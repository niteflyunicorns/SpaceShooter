# NOTES:
* I could not get the Enemy 4 to break apart into pieces like the book had it so I left enemy 4 out ( it is however, completely constructed and scripted - I just did not have time to remove the break-apart part of the script so it could work without throwing errors ).
* The powerup still spawns an M for mine and I thought I had removed it entirely but it still seems to be appearing. This results in the ship lacking a weapon and not being able to get a new one unless there is already a powerup on screen that is unused - essentially leading to game over.
